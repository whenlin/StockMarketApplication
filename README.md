# StockMarketApplication
This Stock Market Application demonstrates the observer design pattern with the RealTimeData class being the subject. Each time a trade is executed, all windows will be updated immediately with the corresponding stock information.

The server that simulates the stock market was implemented using Node.js (JavaScript) whereas the frontend was implemented using the C# .NET Framework. The Model-View-Controller architecture was used as well.
